    <h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>
    <p>"Personal Information" is information about an identifiable individual, which includes, among others, your name, email address, phone number, company, position, and personal opinions. Publicly available information, such as business contact information or information that is aggregated and not associated with a specific individual, is not typically considered Personal Information.</p>

    <h2>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2>
    <p>We only collect Personal Information necessary to establish, manage, and maintain our relationship with you, including your name, email address, phone number(s), company, position, business and/or residential address, and your comments and questions.</p>
    <p>Clientky collects Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you subscribe to alerts, request information about services, or contact us with questions or comments.</p>

    <h2>What Other Information Will We Collect?</h2>
    <p>We collect certain technical information that is recorded through the standard operation of our Site anonymously. This includes your IP address, the operating system and browser type you are using, the sections of the Site you visit, any content you download from the Site, the URL that directed you to the Site, and the date and time of your visit (collectively, "Technical Information"). This Technical Information is used in an aggregated and non-personally identifiable manner.</p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>When you visit the Site, we may collect and store certain information on your computer through "Cookies". Cookies help us in various ways, such as customizing the Site to match your interests and preferences. Most Internet browsers allow you to clear Cookies, block their creation, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored, although this may affect your use of the Site.</p>
    <p>We may use analytics partners such as Google Analytics, Microsoft Clarity, or other similar tools to understand how you use and interact with our website. This data helps us optimize our site and services.</p>

    <p>Your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent, unless required or permitted by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>How Will We Share or Disclose Information?</h2>
    <p>Clientky does not sell or share Personal Information about you that we collect or receive, except as described below or as permitted by law.</p>
    <p>Authorized service providers may process your Personal Information so that we can provide you with the Site and our services. Personal information will only be processed by service providers who have entered into a contract with us that restricts their use of such information and requires them to implement and maintain appropriate security safeguards.</p>

    <p>We use physical, technical, contractual, and administrative safeguards to protect your Personal Information against loss, theft, and unauthorized or illegal access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. However, no Internet-based system is impenetrable, and emails sent to or from the Site may not be secure.</p>
    <p>We will maintain Personal Information only for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or as required by law.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights and Preferences</h2>
    <p>By providing us with your Personal Information, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information for the purposes described in this Policy. You may withdraw your consent to some or all of these purposes by contacting us.</p>
