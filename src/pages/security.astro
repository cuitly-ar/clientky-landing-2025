    <h1>Security Statement</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last updated: December 2025</p>

    <p>Clientky ("we", "our", "us") is committed to strong information security practices, including cybersecurity, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assets, and protection against both external and internal threats.</p>

    <p>This Security Statement is intended to provide you with more information about our security infrastructure and practices. In our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, you can find more details about how we handle the data we collect.</p>

    <h2>Information Security Policy</h2>
    <p>Clientky maintains a written information security policy that defines employee responsibilities and acceptable use of information system resources. This policy is reviewed and updated periodically as needed.</p>

    <h2>Organizational Security</h2>
    <p>Information security roles and responsibilities are defined within the organization. The security team focuses on information security, global security auditing, compliance, and defining security controls to protect Clientky's assets (People, Processes, and Technology).</p>

    <h2>Asset Management</h2>
    <p>Clientky's data and information systems assets are managed under our security policies and procedures. Authorized Clientky personnel who handle these assets must comply with procedures and guidelines defined by Clientky's security policies.</p>

    <h2>Personnel Security</h2>
    <p>Clientky employees are required to conduct themselves consistently with company guidelines, including those related to confidentiality, business ethics, appropriate use, and professional standards. All newly hired employees must sign confidentiality agreements and acknowledge Clientky's code of conduct policy.</p>

    <h2>Physical and Environmental Security</h2>
    <p>Clientky has policies, procedures, and infrastructure to handle both the physical security of its data centers and the environment from which they operate.</p>
    <p>Our information systems and infrastructure are hosted in world-class data centers (such as Azure, AWS, or other similar providers) that are geographically dispersed to provide high availability and redundancy.</p>

    <h2>Secure Network Connections</h2>
    <p>HTTPS encryption is configured for web application access. This helps ensure that user data in transit is secure and available only to intended recipients.</p>

    <h2>Network Security</h2>
    <p>Our infrastructure servers reside behind high-availability firewalls and are monitored for detection and prevention of various network security threats. Firewalls are used to restrict access to systems from external networks and between systems internally.</p>
    <p>Clientky maintains separate development and production environments. We ensure proper network segmentation through the establishment of security zones that control the flow of network traffic.</p>

    <h2>Software Development Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>We follow a defined methodology for developing secure software designed to increase the resilience and reliability of our products. Security and security testing are implemented throughout the entire software development methodology.</p>
    <p>Our secure development lifecycle follows standard security practices, including vulnerability testing, regression testing, penetration testing, and product security assessments.</p>

    <h2>Data Protection</h2>
    <p>Clientky continuously works to develop products that support the latest recommended encryption suites and secure protocols for encrypting traffic while in transit. We apply a common set of personal data management principles to customer data that we may process, handle, and store.</p>

    <h2>Incident Management</h2>
    <p>Clientky has a formalized incident response plan (Incident Response Plan) and associated procedures in case of an information security incident.</p>

    <h2>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</h2>
    <p>We implement a disaster recovery program to minimize service disruptions due to hardware failures, natural disasters, or catastrophes.</p>
